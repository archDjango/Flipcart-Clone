Backend
Framework: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MySQL
ORM: Sequelize (for MySQL)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Payment Gateway: Razorpay or Stripe
API Testing: Postman

Cloud Storage
Image Storage: AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Cloudinary

Deployment
Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
Backend: AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean
Database: AWS RDS or MySQL on the same server as the backend

4. Database Design
Tables
Users
id (Primary Key), name, email, password, phone, address, created_at

Products
id (Primary Key), name, description, price, category_id, image_url, stock, created_at

Categories
id (Primary Key), name, parent_category_id (for subcategories)

Orders
id (Primary Key), user_id, total_amount, status, payment_id, created_at

Order Items
id (Primary Key), order_id, product_id, quantity, price

Cart
id (Primary Key), user_id, product_id, quantity

Wishlist
id (Primary Key), user_id, product_id




5. API Endpoints
   
User Routes
POST /api/register - User registration
POST /api/login - User login
GET /api/profile - Get user profile
PUT /api/profile - Update user profile

Product Routes
GET /api/products - Get all products
GET /api/products/:id - Get product details
POST /api/products - Add a new product (Admin only)
PUT /api/products/:id - Update a product (Admin only)
DELETE /api/products/:id - Delete a product (Admin only)

Cart Routes
GET /api/cart - Get user's cart
POST /api/cart - Add item to cart
DELETE /api/cart/:id - Remove item from cart

Order Routes
POST /api/orders - Create an order
GET /api/orders - Get user's orders
GET /api/orders/:id - Get order details

Admin Routes
GET /api/admin/orders - Get all orders
PUT /api/admin/orders/:id - Update order status
GET /api/admin/users - Get all users


6. Payment Integration
Integrate a payment gateway like Razorpay or Stripe.
Use webhooks to handle payment success/failure events.
Example flow:
User initiates payment.
Backend creates a payment order with the payment gateway.
User completes payment on the gateway's page.
Gateway sends a webhook to confirm payment status.
Backend updates the order status.

7. Frontend Design
Home Page: Display featured products, categories, and banners.
Product Page: Show product details, images, and reviews.
Cart Page: Display items in the cart with total price.
Checkout Page: Collect shipping details and process payment.
Admin Dashboard: Manage products, orders, and users.



8. Security Considerations
Use HTTPS for secure communication.
Hash passwords using bcrypt.
Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
Use JWT for secure authentication.


9. Testing

Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions.
Integration Testing: Test API endpoints and database interactions.
End-to-End Testing: Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to test user flows.


10. Deployment

Frontend: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Deploy on AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
Database: Use AWS RDS or MySQL on the same server as the backend.
CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment.


11. Future Enhancements

Add product reviews and ratings.
Implement a recommendation engine.
Add multi-language support.
Integrate with third-party logistics for shipping.


12. Tools and Resources

UI Design: Figma or Adobe XD
Version Control: Git and GitHub
API Documentation: Swagger or Postman
Project Management: Trello or Jira
